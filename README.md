# Philips_Curve
In this project, I replicated the Philips Curve with the most up-to-date economic statistics from the Federal Reserve Economic Data(FRED), comparing the inflation index with the unemployment rate. 

For my measure of inflation, I used the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index and manipulated to obtain the year over year percentage change. I used the Unemployment Rate for my measure of unemployment, that is also on the year over year basis.

I cleaned the datasets containing the relevant data and, for visualization, concised the dataframe to be within the twenty-first century. I colored the scatter dots differently by year range that is determined or categorized by the corresponding significant economic events. I then performed polynomial regression of the inflation measure on the unemployment measure and plotted the best fitted curve on the scatterplot.
